# Client Server Template (for WAX blockchain developers)

## Introduction

Enabling Adoption: Introducing a Powerful Client/Server Framework for WAX Blockchain

One of the key challenges in the adoption of a blockchain standard is user-friendliness. The quantity and quality of applications within the ecosystem play a significant role in driving adoption. It is crucial, therefore, to simplify the development of applications for this technology and provide access to comprehensive technical documentation.

As WAX guilds, we are committed to facilitating adoption, and at 3DK Render, we aim to contribute by introducing a client/server framework that serves as a template for building robust applications on WAX Blockchain.

This template has an educational nature and should be customized to meet the specific requirements of each project. However, it is fully functional, and we have incorporated the latest and most popular tools and techniques that our team has developed throughout our experience as WAX Blockchain developers.

We are dedicated to keeping this template up to date and continuously incorporating the tools that the WAX community requires. Our goal is to make the development process smoother and more efficient for both experienced and aspiring developers in the WAX ecosystem.

Key Features:

- Streamlined Development: Our framework provides a structured approach to WAX Blockchain application development, reducing development time and effort.
- Modern Tools: We have integrated the most cutting-edge tools, ensuring that developers have access to the latest advancements in blockchain technology.
- Documentation: Detailed technical documentation accompanies the framework, serving as a valuable resource for developers at all skill levels.
- Community-Driven Updates: We actively engage with the WAX community to understand their needs and incorporate new features and improvements accordingly.
- Flexibility: While the template provides a solid foundation, it is designed to be customizable, allowing developers to tailor it to their specific project requirements.

By leveraging this framework, developers can accelerate their application development process, focus on building innovative features, and contribute to the growing ecosystem of WAX Blockchain applications. Our aim is to empower developers to create powerful, user-friendly, and commercially successful applications.

Join us on this exciting journey as we drive the adoption of WAX Blockchain and shape the future of decentralized applications. Together, we can build a thriving ecosystem that revolutionizes the way we interact with digital assets.

Let's build a decentralized future on WAX Blockchain!

## Description

- Server side: Create a backend server for a WAX blockchain dApp using Node, Express, and MongoDB.
- Client side: Create a frontend client for WAX blockchain dApp using React and redux.

## Installation

The project consists of two separate folders, one for the client and one for the server. It is recommended that these folders be treated independently, even on different computers in production.

The template must be adapted to the needs of each project, so we recommend the following steps for its use:

- Fork the project to have a copy on your own GitHub.
- Customise your version as you wish.
- Install the client and server separately.

### Client

```bash
cd Client
npm install
```

### Server

```bash
cd Server
npm install
```

## Requirements
- Client and server must be running at the same time.
- Client and server must be running on different ports.
- Client and server can be running on different machines (recomedend for production)

## Usage

See documentation for each part of this project to learn how to use it.

## Disclaimer

This template is provided as is, without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement.

The template is for educational purposes and is not an out-of-the-box tool. It needs to be customised to meet the desired requirements in each case.

For this reason it is necessary for the developer to have knowledge in Typescript and, specifically, in the use of services such as:

- Node
- Express
- MongoDB
- React
- Redux

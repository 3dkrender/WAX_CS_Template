# WAX Server Architecture Refactoring

## Version
- Project version remains at `0.10.0`
- This PR implements Clean Architecture and caching system as part of the enhanced architecture and design patterns milestone

## Description
This PR implements a complete refactoring of the server architecture following Clean Architecture principles and improving system scalability.

## Main Changes

### New Architecture Structure
- Implementation of Clean Architecture with well-defined layers
- Clear separation of concerns
- Better code organization for maintainability

### Performance Improvements
- In-memory caching system implementation
- Response time optimization
- Intelligent TTL management by operation type

### Code Improvements
- Strong typing with TypeScript
- Well-defined interfaces
- Better error handling
- Improved documentation

## Technical Details

### New Features
- Caching system with `node-cache`
- Singleton pattern for cache management
- Automatic cache invalidation in transactions
- Detailed architecture documentation

├── infrastructure/   # Technical implementations
└── presentation/     # API and controllers
```

### Updated Endpoints
- `/api/getinfo`: Blockchain information
- `/api/getusertokens/:user`: User tokens
- `/api/get_table_rows/:code/:scope/:table`: Table data

## Testing
- Existing tests maintained
- Structure prepared for new unit tests
- Better testing capability through layer separation

## Documentation
- New architecture documentation in `Server/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Improved inline documentation
- Updated usage examples

## Breaking Changes
- No breaking changes in public API
- Compatibility maintained with existing endpoints
- Environment variables remain the same

## Next Steps
- [ ] Implement unit tests for new components
- [ ] Add performance metrics
- [ ] Consider rate limiting implementation
- [ ] Evaluate need for distributed cache for horizontal scalability
